# Calendar Booking System Setup Instructions

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Environment Variables (Optional)

The system is configured with your provided credentials as defaults, so it will work out of the box! However, for production, create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Gmail SMTP Configuration
GMAIL_USER=jainpriyanshu2982001@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password_here

# Google Calendar API Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=507834482501-on31s99jj9p8ihicgqm873e5r1i7tlde.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback

# Your Calendar ID (usually your email address)
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=jainpriyanshu2982001@gmail.com
```

**Note**: The system will use your provided credentials as defaults if environment variables are not found, so it should work immediately!

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup

2. Navigate to Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification
3. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your `.env.local`
